                    The Application utilizes third-party services to provide advertisements, host content, and manage PDF links. These services have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the third-party services used by the Application:
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Some functions of the Application, such as accessing PDF links or advertisements, require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    If you use the Application outside of a Wi-Fi area, your mobile network provider’s agreement terms apply. You may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage or roaming charges if you use the Application outside your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. By using the Application, you accept responsibility for any such charges. If you are not the bill payer for the device, it is assumed you have obtained permission from the bill payer.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    While the Service Provider strives to ensure the Application is updated and accurate, they rely on third parties (e.g., Cloudinary, Supabase) to provide content such as notes, question papers, and PDF links. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on the functionality or content of the Application. It is your responsibility to ensure your device remains charged and operational to access the Application.

                    The Service Provider may update the Application to improve functionality or compatibility. The Application is currently available on Android and other systems as supported, but requirements may change, and you will need to download updates to continue using the Application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that updates will always be provided or that the Application will remain compatible with your device’s operating system. You agree to accept updates when offered.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The Service Provider may cease providing the Application and terminate its use at any time without notice.
